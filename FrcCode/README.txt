This directory contains the default code for the Innovation First 2004 Full-size Robot Controller.

To compile this code you must have Microchip's MPLAB IDE with their C18 compiler installed on your system.

If you wish to restore your Full-size Robot Controller to the default functionality as shipped from the factory, use the IFI Loader application to download the FRC_default.hex file to your Robot Controller.

CAUTION:  Do not relocate this FrcCode directory very deep in your directory tree.  This is because the Microchip compiler has a 64 character path/filename limit.

Notes:
Use FRC_library.lib (default) if you plan to use the Generate_Pwms() function.  This uses Timer0 to synchronize any PWM outputs generated by the User processor to make sure they avoid any SPI interrupts.
If you want to use Timer0 yourself, then you can replace FRC_library.lib with FRC_alltimers.lib in the project.
